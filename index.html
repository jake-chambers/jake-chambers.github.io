                        I am a solution driven software engineer looking to increase versatility through project
                        involvement. I have full
                        stack experience in designing and implementing web-applications and have work experience in the
                        field of application
                        security.

                        Aside from my technical abilities, I am a very sociable person and love to stay active. I am a
                        strong believer in
                        putting everything you've got into everything you do. I enjoy picking up new skills, and
                        polishing
                        existing skills to
                        become the best all-around person I can be.

                            Awarded most innovative project. Fourth year capstone project that can predict human emotion
                            through vocal input using
                            machine learning techniques (Keras & Tensorflow). This project set out to determine the
                            emotion of the user based on only vocal analysis. To do this a convolutional
                            neural network was used to train a model that could predict emotions with ~%80 accuracy.

                            I currently work as a developer at an investment company. I have the opportunity to fiddle
                            around with a lot of data
                            regarding stocks, bonds, etc. I was interested in what the returns would be today if you
                            invested in certain stocks at
                            some past date. There was no application online that I found that could take care of this
                            request so I built one myself.

                            Dolphin was intended to solve the issue of sending money to your peers when you don't have a
                            data connection available
                            or WiFi. The transactions are sent over sound and received on the peers device and
                            processed later once connected to
                            the internet. Dolphin uses an API created by Authorize.net in order to achieve a sandbox
                            environment for money tranfers.
                            Dolphin was awarded best API use at Hack Western 5.
